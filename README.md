Hi, I'm `somebeaver` on GitHub, `Brian` irl.

I make web apps using JavaScript and deploy them to the internet, desktop, and mobile.

I designed and developed [Cardinal](https://cardinalapps.xyz), a suite of apps for your personal media. I also wrote a few open source libraries for making web applications.
